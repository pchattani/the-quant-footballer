<h5>Source</h5>
<p>Almost everything on the site comes from <strong>Sofascore's unofficial JSON API</strong>. It is unofficial: there is no licence, no documentation and no guarantee, and Sofascore blocks datacenter addresses outright, so nothing can be fetched from the cloud. Fetching runs only on the owner's home connection through a scheduled task; the site's build and deployment run in GitHub Actions from the stores that task commits. The client presents a browser TLS fingerprint and tries two hosts in order (<code>api.sofascore.com</code>, then <code>api.sofavpn.com</code>); a call that fails on both returns nothing rather than raising.</p>
<h5>What a match record holds</h5>
<p>The fixture list of a season costs two unbudgeted calls (past and future pages). Each match is stored with its Sofascore id, both club names canonicalised through a per-league name registry (so "Liverpool FC" in the Champions League is the same club as "Liverpool" in the league store), the round (a number, or a knockout key such as <code>r16</code>, <code>qf</code>, <code>sf</code>, <code>final</code>, <code>po</code>, <code>r32</code>), the status, the score, the kickoff in UTC, the stage (<code>league</code>, <code>playoff</code>, <code>qualifying</code>, <code>split</code>, <code>other</code>), the group, the penalty-shootout winner where a drawn tie was settled, the aggregate winner on a second leg, and the team ids and countries that link a cup entrant back to its league.</p>
<p>A finished match can then be given <strong>detail</strong>, which costs five budgeted calls: the line-ups with 72 kept statistics per player (minutes, scoring and creation, passing and carrying, defending and duels, goalkeeping, physical output and Sofascore's rating; unused substitutes are dropped), the team-statistics sheet (whole-match values such as possession, expected goals, shots, passes, box touches, with denominators kept for ratio rows), the shot map (each shot's position as a distance from the goal line and a position across the pitch, its xG and xGOT, type, body part, situation, minute, goal-mouth coordinates and the goalkeeper faced), the momentum graph and the incident list (goals, cards, substitutions, VAR). A match "counts" as detailed only when its line-ups arrived with at least one player's statistics.</p>
<h5>The hourly refresh</h5>
<p>One scheduled task runs every hour on the owner's machine, in this order: the Argentine league (budget 100 detail calls), discovery of up to six competitions not yet mapped to Sofascore ids, every other league, cup and national-team competition in one process (budget 150), and the archive of past seasons and player careers (budget 60). It commits the stores once and pushes. A GitHub Actions workflow runs at 17 minutes past every hour: it hydrates each store from the public site's copy when that copy has more matches or more line-ups, runs the build (about half an hour for all competitions), and syncs <code>docs/site/</code> to the public repository. The build writes JSON only; the pages you are reading are static files that fetch that JSON.</p>
<h5>Budgets and pacing</h5>
<p>Detail is charged at five calls per match, so the default budget of 150 covers thirty matches an hour, taken round-robin across every competition that has matches waiting, newest first. Fixture pages, probes and discovery are not charged. The fetcher pauses half a second between fixture pages, a quarter of a second after each detail call and a second between matches, and stops at the first HTTP 403 or after three consecutive matches without line-ups. A competition whose store has no match within seven days either side of today, and whose fixtures were refreshed within the last day, is <strong>dormant</strong> and skipped, which keeps the hourly call count down through the off-season.</p>
<h5>The 403 challenge</h5>
<p>Sofascore answers HTTP 403 to every endpoint from an address it has decided to challenge. It is triggered by bursts (once after about 3,000 calls in one sitting; once, on 29 September 2026, after fewer than a thousand in an hour when a manual backfill and the hourly task overlapped), it lasts on the order of thirteen hours, and every call made while challenged is wasted and may prolong it. Every fetcher therefore probes with a single call before doing anything, exits when blocked, and never runs a backfill on top of the hourly task. When a refresh fails the site simply keeps serving the last good data; a competition whose store is more than 24 hours old shows a "could not be refreshed" banner, and one whose most recent match is more than 30 days old (60 for cups, 120 for national teams) is flagged as possibly out of season.</p>
<h5>The calendar backfill</h5>
<p>Behind the current season's needs, the fetcher also queues last season's finished matches dated within the past 365 days that have no detail, newest first, under the same hourly budget. That detail feeds the Player lab's "last 12 months" and "calendar year so far" views, where a player five matches into a new league season is compared on the same stretch of calendar as one twenty matches in. As of 30 September 2026 that is roughly 4,000 matches, about 20,000 calls, so the window fills over about a week once the address is clear. Season pages never count that detail: every season aggregate is built from the store restricted to the current season's matches.</p>
<h5>What exists for older matches, and what does not</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Previous season</strong>: fixtures, results and dates only. They train the match model as goals rows (section 2); they carry no xG, no line-ups and no player statistics.</li>
<li><strong>Thin detail</strong>: matches fetched by the older fetchers have line-ups with a short statistic list (roughly twelve to twenty-six keys) and no team sheet, so they contribute xG and basic player lines but no possession, field tilt, PPDA, xGOT-against or physical data. The hourly task upgrades a few such matches per run to the full format, newest first.</li>
<li><strong>Followed-only detail</strong>: national cups, super cups and the Leagues Cup fetch detail only for matches in which at least one side is a club of a followed league, so a tie between two lower-division clubs has a result and nothing else.</li>
<li><strong>The match centre degrades per section</strong>: a match with no shard shows the header and the model line; one in the thin format shows the shot map and xG race but not the team sheet, formations or goal-mouth views.</li>
<li><strong>Names</strong>: a spelling the registry does not know is kept as Sofascore spells it, which can leave a club out of a join (the table, a cup entrant's league) until an alias is added. Crests are fetched by hand and committed; a missing crest shows as a monogram.</li>
</ul>
<p>The archive (past season tables, season leaders and player careers) fills at 60 calls an hour. It feeds the season picker's older editions (official final tables and leaders, no match list) and the season-by-season rows on each player's page that predate the match stores.</p>` });

  S.push({ id: 'match-model', title: 'The match model', html: `
<p>Every probability on the site starts from a ${G('dixon_coles', 'Dixon-Coles')} model blended with an ${G('elo', 'Elo')} rating. The Dixon-Coles fit gives each team an attack and a defence parameter and returns a full score distribution for any fixture; Elo is a slow-moving prior and a fallback; the blend is calibrated to each competition's own draw rate and scoring.</p>
<h5>Dixon-Coles: parameterisation</h5>
${formula('lam_home = exp(att[home] + def[away] + home_adv)\nlam_away = exp(att[away] + def[home])')}
<p>A higher ${G('attack')} means more goals scored; a higher ${G('defence')} means more goals conceded, so a good defence has a negative value. ${G('home_adv', 'Home advantage')} is one global term, set to zero when a fixture is priced as neutral. The parameter vector holds every team's attack and defence plus home advantage and rho (2n + 2 entries); teams are sorted alphabetically and the first team's defence is fixed at 0 as the anchor. The fit has no neutral-venue term: a neutral match trains home advantage as if the listed home side were at home, and neutrality is honoured only at prediction time and in the Elo replay.</p>
<h5>Likelihood, time decay and ridge</h5>
<p>Each training match gets a weight that decays with age, with an optional per-row weight (friendlies count half in the international fit):</p>
${formula('w_i = exp(−xi × days_ago_i) × weight_i')}
<p><strong>Goals rows</strong> (matches without xG on both sides) use the Dixon-Coles likelihood: independent Poissons with the low-score correction tau, whose strength is ${G('rho')}:</p>
${formula('ll_i = log Pois(hg; lam_h) + log Pois(ag; lam_a) + log tau\n\ntau(0,0) = 1 − lam_h × lam_a × rho     tau(1,0) = 1 + lam_a × rho\ntau(0,1) = 1 + lam_h × rho             tau(1,1) = 1 − rho\ntau(x,y) = 1 otherwise')}
<p><strong>xG rows</strong> (current-season matches with line-ups, where team xG is the sum of the players' Sofascore expected goals) replace the goals entirely with a continuous Poisson likelihood on the two xG totals, with no tau:</p>
${formula('ll_i = hx × log(lam_h) − lam_h − lgamma(hx + 1) + ax × log(lam_a) − lam_a − lgamma(ax + 1)')}
<p>This is a substitution, not a blend: a match with xG contributes only its xG, a match without contributes only its goals, and club xG is used raw (Sofascore's sums, not rescaled to goals). Because rho appears only in goals rows, it is identified only by matches without xG. The objective adds a ${G('ridge')} penalty on the team parameters, not on home advantage or rho:</p>
${formula('minimise   −Σ w_i × ll_i  +  ridge × (Σ att² + Σ def²)')}
<p>The ridge is not scaled by the number of matches. As the data ages every weight shrinks by the same factor while the ridge stays fixed, so the effective regularisation strengthens with wall-clock time and parameters drift very slowly towards zero even with no new matches (about 3 × 10⁻⁵ on a home-win probability per day). The fit is <code>scipy</code>'s L-BFGS-B with numerical gradients, starting from all team parameters at 0, home advantage 0.1 and rho −0.1; rho is bounded in [−0.99, 0]. A fit needs at least 50 matches (30 for the international fit).</p>
<h5>Prediction</h5>
<p>For any pairing the model builds a 9 × 9 matrix of <code>Pois(i; lam_h) × Pois(j; lam_a) × tau(i, j)</code> (goals 0 to 8 each way), clamps negative cells to zero and renormalises, which discards the mass above eight goals. Home win, draw and away win are the lower triangle, the trace and the upper triangle. A team missing from the fit gets attack = defence = 0, the centre of the ridge prior. Negative "scores" that Sofascore uses for voided or awarded matches are dropped before fitting, and a non-finite likelihood aborts the fit rather than silently freezing every club at average.</p>
<h5>Parameters</h5>
${kv([
  ['Time decay (xi)', 'per league, tuned: 0.001 to 0.008 (the pooled set 0.0035; class default 0.0018); own-fit cups 0.0035; international 0.002', 'half-life ln 2 / xi: about 198 days at 0.0035, 87 at 0.008'],
  ['Ridge', 'per league, tuned: 0.25 to 2.0; pooled 1.0; cups 1.0; international 1.0', ''],
  ['Maximum goals', '8', 'every competition'],
  ['Rho bounds', '[−0.99, 0]', 'fixed'],
  ['Minimum matches to fit', '50 (leagues, cups, Argentina, the pool); 30 (international)', 'below it the ensemble is Elo only']
])}
<h5>Elo</h5>
${formula('dr  = R_home − R_away + (home_advantage if not neutral else 0)\nE_h = 1 / (1 + 10^(−dr / 400))\nS_h = 1 (win), 0.5 (draw), 0 (loss)\nR_home += K × (S_h − E_h);   R_away += K × ((1 − S_h) − (1 − E_h))')}
<p>Goal difference is ignored: only the result enters, with no margin-of-victory multiplier, and the update uses the same home-advantage-adjusted expectation the model predicts, so home wins are not over-rewarded. Leagues seed each club at <code>1500 + (n_teams − last season's rank) × 15</code>, with promoted clubs at the bottom, then replay every training match. K comes from each league's tuned parameters (15, 20 or 30; the pooled set uses 30, the class default is 20) and home advantage from the same file (30 to 70 points). Cups use K 20 and 50 points but <strong>never seed or update</strong>, so every club sits at 1500 and the Elo column of a cup's power rankings is flat; the international fit uses K 20 and 50 points, unseeded, replaying every national-team match (friendlies at full weight here, unlike in the Dixon-Coles fit).</p>
<h5>The ensemble and dc_weight</h5>
<p>The ${G('ensemble', 'blend')} weight adapts to what is known about the two teams:</p>
${formula('dc_w = 0                            if Dixon-Coles is unfitted, or |rho| ≥ 0.99\n     = max(dc_weight − 0.30, 0.40)  if either team has no attack parameter\n     = dc_weight                    otherwise\nelo_w = 1 − dc_w')}
<p>On the Elo side the logistic expectation is read as the home-win probability and the rest of the mass is split with the competition's measured draw rate; an Elo score matrix comes from independent Poissons with means <code>max(p_E × lam_scale, 0.3)</code> and <code>max((1 − p_E) × lam_scale, 0.3)</code>. The blend is linear and renormalised:</p>
${formula('H = dc_w × H_DC + elo_w × elo_home   (likewise D and A)\nscore_matrix = normalise(dc_w × M_DC + elo_w × M_Elo)\nlambda_home / lambda_away = the Dixon-Coles lambdas')}
<p>Tuned dc_weight is 0.65 to 1.0 in the leagues and 1.0 in every cup and the international fit; with 1.0 Elo enters only when a club is unknown to the fit, at weight 0.30, and in a cup that Elo is a pure home-advantage prior (p_E = 0.571 for the home side). One inconsistency to know about: on a blended fixture the win/draw/loss triple (a linear blend using Elo's draw-rate split) and the triple implied by the blended score matrix (which uses Elo's Poisson matrix) can differ by a few points. The simulators sample from the matrix; the fixture line, the ladder and the strength table read the triple.</p>
<h5>Calibration</h5>
<p>Measured from each model's own training matches: the ${G('calibration', 'draw rate')} is the share of level scores, <code>mean_goals</code> is the average of the mean home and mean away goals, and <code>lam_scale = 2 × mean_goals</code>. The home-win rate is reported on the competition's methodology card but not used. A competition with fewer than 30 training rows takes the defaults (draw rate 0.25, scale 2.6, 1.3 goals per team, 45% home wins). The away penalty on the Elo side is 1.0 everywhere on this site (the legacy World Cup site used 0.75).</p>
<h5>Fair odds and the fixture line</h5>
<p>Every unplayed fixture carries the model line. <strong>h, d, a</strong> are the ensemble probabilities; <strong>lh, la</strong> the Dixon-Coles expected goals; ${G('o25', 'over 2.5')} is the sum of matrix cells with i + j ≥ 3; ${G('btts', 'both to score')} the sum of cells with i ≥ 1 and j ≥ 1; the most likely score is the largest cell. ${G('fair_odds', 'Fair odds')} are <code>1 / p</code> rounded to two decimals, blank below p = 0.005, with <strong>no margin</strong>: they are what the model thinks, not a price anyone offers. A fixture is priced as neutral when the store flags it or the competition's rules say so (cup finals and neutral rounds, and the national-team tournaments played at neutral venues).</p>
<h5>How the parameters were chosen</h5>
<p>A tuner scores each league by walk-forward three-way log-loss on its own matches (expanding folds: 200 matches minimum, six folds), in three stages: Dixon-Coles alone over xi × ridge, Elo alone over home advantage × K, then the blend weight. Four candidates compete: the league's own best, one global set minimising the match-weighted loss across leagues, a pooled fit over all leagues, and the defaults. The global set is the reference; the pooled, then the per-league, candidate replaces it only by beating it by 0.002 of log-loss, and the winner must also beat the better of two baselines, uniform (ln 3 = 1.0986) and a home-advantage-only prior. The file tuned on 22 September 2026 reads:</p>
${simpleTable(['League', 'Method', 'xi', 'ridge', 'Elo HA', 'K', 'dc_weight', 'log-loss', 'baseline'], [
  ['Premier League', 'pooled', '0.0035', '1.0', '50', '30', '1.0', '1.051', '1.099'], ['LaLiga', 'global', '0.002', '2.0', '50', '30', '1.0', '0.992', '1.044'],

<p>A league whose method is "pooled" reads the build's pooled fit (section 3) through a view that strips the league prefixes; if that fit is unavailable it falls back to its own fit with the same parameters. Note that the tuner's pooled candidate contained leagues only, while the deployed pool includes the cups.</p>` });

  S.push({ id: 'pooled', title: 'The pooled scale', html: `

<h5>Club prefixes and cups as bridges</h5>
<p>The training frame takes every followed league except Argentina, with each club renamed <code>&lt;league-slug&gt;:&lt;club&gt;</code>, plus every cup store whose family is not national teams. A cup entrant is renamed to its league's prefix when its country maps to a followed league and the club appears in that league's frame; otherwise it keeps the cup's own prefix, <code>&lt;cup-slug&gt;:&lt;club&gt;</code>. Cup matches between clubs of different leagues are therefore the <strong>only edges connecting the leagues' parameter blocks</strong>; without them the leagues would be separate components identified only by the ridge. The fit uses xi 0.0035 and ridge 1.0, needs at least 50 rows, covers roughly 530 clubs with about 1,060 parameters, and is the slowest step of the build.</p>
<p>Two consequences of the prefixing: a club from a league the site does not follow exists once per cup it plays in, with no shared parameters (an Argentine club can be both <code>libertadores:X</code> and <code>copa-argentina:X</code>); and Argentina, whose own model is fitted separately, always carries cup prefixes in the pool.</p>
<h5>Reading the pool back</h5>
${formula('att_bar, def_bar = mean attack / defence over clubs under a league prefix\n\nfor each club c (neutral venue, against the average club):\n  M          = score matrix(att_c, def_c, att_bar, def_bar, rho, home_adv = 0)\n  strength   = 3 × P(win) + P(draw)          expected points per game v the pool-average club\n  xg_for     = exp(att_c + def_bar)\n  xg_against = exp(att_bar + def_c)\n\nfor each league L (means over its clubs):\n  factor_att = exp(def_bar − mean_def_L)     scoring-rate multiplier for players (< 1: weaker defences)\n  factor_def = exp(att_bar − mean_att_L)\n  strength   = mean club strength; leagues ranked by it\n  connection = cup-match appearances by L\'s clubs')}
<p>The pool's own home advantage and rho are shown on the Clubs page and used by the in-browser pricer ("If they met" and the compare page), which rebuilds the score matrix from two clubs' attack and defence exactly as above, with home advantage applied or not according to the venue toggle.</p>
<h5>Why cross-block ranks are weak</h5>
<p>Each league and continental cup belongs to a block: Europe, South America, North America, Asia, Africa or World (the Club World Cup and the Intercontinental Cup). Within Europe the UEFA competitions connect the leagues every week. Between blocks the fit has only a handful of matches, time-decayed (on 29 September 2026: Asia–World 3, North America–South America 1, South America–World 1, Europe–South America 1, six in all). The ridge pulls every block towards the same centre, so a cross-block league ranking mostly reflects each block's internal spread and the prior, not measured strength. The <code>connection</code> count also overstates bridging, because domestic cups mostly link a league to itself or to lower-division clubs. Treat cross-block rankings, the scoring factors that depend on them, and any club-versus-club price across blocks as the model's best guess with wide error; the Clubs page prints the bridge counts for this reason.</p>
<h5>Scoring factors and league-adjusted rates</h5>
<p>For the global leaderboards and the Player lab, every qualified player's attacking rates per 90 (goals, non-penalty goals, assists, xG, npxG, xA, xGOT, shots, key passes and big chances; the lab adds npxG + xA, goals + assists and shots + key passes) are multiplied by the competition's <code>factor_att</code> into a ${G('league_adjusted', 'league-adjusted')} twin. Only the twelve pooled leagues have a factor; cups, national-team competitions and Argentina get 1.0, which is no adjustment. Percentiles are then recomputed over the whole pool of qualified players by position, with a global minutes floor of 270. In a calendar window a player who played in several competitions carries the minutes-weighted blend of their factors.</p>` });

  S.push({ id: 'national-teams', title: 'National teams', html: `
<p>National teams are fitted separately from the club pool, on every national-team store the site follows: the World Cup, the Euro, Copa América, the Nations Leagues, the qualifiers, AFCON, the Asian Cup, the Gold Cup and the friendlies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Friendlies at half weight.</strong> Rows from the friendlies competition carry <code>weight = 0.5</code> in the Dixon-Coles likelihood; everything else counts 1.0. (The Elo replay counts friendlies in full.)</li>
<li><strong>Neutral venues.</strong> Tournaments played on neutral ground (World Cup, Euro, Copa América, AFCON, Asian Cup, Gold Cup) mark every match neutral. The fit itself drops that column, so one home-advantage term serves qualifiers and neutral finals alike; neutrality is honoured when a fixture is priced and in the Elo replay.</li>
<li><strong>Parameters.</strong> Dixon-Coles with xi 0.002 and ridge 1.0 on at least 30 matches; Elo with K 20 and 50 points of home advantage, unseeded; ensemble with dc_weight 1.0 and the fit's own draw rate and scale.</li>
<li><strong>Not simulated.</strong> National-team competitions publish their tables and knockout ladders as played, and each fixture carries the fit's line; there is no season simulation, no probabilities tab and no history. The banner on those pages says so.</li>
<li><strong>Ratings.</strong> The National teams page ranks every nation by strength: 3 × P(win) + P(draw) against the mean nation (mean attack and mean defence over all fitted nations) at a neutral venue, alongside attack, defence, Elo and matches played.</li>
</ul>
${note('The fit is wide but shallow. On 2 October 2026 it rests on about 4,000 matches for 234 nations, a median of 33 per nation, with 25 nations on fewer than five. National teams play few competitive matches a year and rarely meet across confederations, so ranks between confederations lean on the ridge prior and on a handful of World Cup and intercontinental play-off meetings.', true)}` });

  S.push({ id: 'simulations', title: 'Simulations', html: `
<p>Every season probability is a ${G('monte_carlo', 'Monte Carlo')} estimate: the remainder of the season is played out many times by sampling each remaining match from the model's score matrix, and a probability is the share of simulations in which the thing happened.</p>
<h5>Sampling</h5>
<p>A sampler caches one flattened score distribution per (home, away, neutral) pairing, so the model is called once per pairing however many simulations run; a draw is a binary search into that distribution. A degenerate matrix (no mass, or non-finite) falls back to independent Poissons with mean 1.2. The published site runs <strong>30,000 simulations</strong> per competition, in chunks of 25,000 with random seed 42 (the count is on each competition's meta line; the build's default is 100,000 and its <code>--sims</code> flag sets it). The Monte Carlo standard error on a probability is at most sqrt(0.25 / 30,000), about 0.003. Points quantiles (<code>p05</code>, <code>p50</code>, <code>p95</code>) are taken from the first 2,000 simulations only.</p>
<h5>Leagues</h5>
<ol>
<li>Points, goals for and against and wins are seeded from finished matches.</li>
<li>Every remaining non-playoff fixture is sampled for all simulations at once.</li>
<li>Each simulated table is ranked on the competition's tiebreak: points, goal difference, goals scored by default; points, wins, goal difference, goals scored in the Brasileirão and MLS; then a uniform random jitter as the drawing of lots, which avoids an alphabetical bias.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Head-to-head is not simulated.</strong> LaLiga and Serie A break level points on head-to-head record; the simulator cannot vectorise that and uses goal difference and goals scored instead, which matters only for clubs finishing exactly level. The outputs are the ${G('bands', 'position distribution')} (the finishing-position heatmap), the title probability, ${G('exp_pts', 'expected points')} and quantiles, band probabilities (each band sums the position distribution over its places; MLS bands read the conference table and Belgium's the post-split table), and each team's mean remaining goals, which feed the top-scorer model.</p>
<h5>Split seasons (Belgium)</h5>
<p>After the regular season each simulation splits its own table into a championship group of 6, a Europe group of 6 and a relegation group of 6. Carried points are <code>ceil(points / 2)</code>; goal difference and goals carry over unhalved. Each group plays a double round-robin sampled per simulation and is ranked on (points, goal difference, goals, lots). The champion is first in the championship group and the bands read the post-split order. The split is always simulated from the full regular-season table; a split already under way is not recognised.</p>
<h5>Playoffs, two-legged ties, extra time and penalties</h5>
<p>A single-leg tie hosted by one side is resolved from the match matrix with the draw split between extra time, weighted by strength, and a shootout that is a coin flip:</p>
${formula('P(home advances) = H + D × (etw × H / (H + A) + (1 − etw) × 0.5)        etw = 0.5')}
<p>A neutral single leg (cup finals, neutral rounds, the Argentine final) symmetrises the venue: <code>p = 0.5 × (A1[h, a] + 1 − A1[a, h])</code>. A two-legged tie convolves the goal-difference distributions of the two legs (the second leg's host reversed) to get the aggregate; there is no away-goals rule, and a level aggregate is split exactly as a single-leg draw.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MLS Cup playoffs</strong>, per conference: seeds 1–7 qualify directly; 8 hosts 9 in a single wildcard match; Round One is best-of-three (1 v wildcard winner, 2 v 7, 3 v 6, 4 v 5) with the higher seed hosting games one and three, <code>P(series) = p_h p_a + p_h (1 − p_a) p_h + (1 − p_h) p_a p_h</code>; winners are re-seeded; the semi-finals and conference finals are single matches at the better seed; MLS Cup is hosted by the finalist with more regular-season points.</li>
<li><strong>Liga MX Liguilla</strong>: play-in 7 v 8 and 9 v 10, the 7-v-8 loser hosting the 9-v-10 winner for the last place; quarter-finals 1 v 8, 2 v 7, 3 v 6, 4 v 5; semi-finals and the final re-seeded, all three rounds two-legged with the higher seed at home in the second leg. Two-legged ties here use an extra-time weight of 1.0, so a level aggregate goes entirely by the strength share (the real rule favours the higher seed).</li>
<li><strong>Argentina</strong>: two zones of 15; the top 8 of each zone enter a fixed single-leg tree (A1–B8, A4–B5, A2–B7, A3–B6, B1–A8, B4–A5, B2–A7, B3–A6), the better zone rank hosting, with a neutral final. The Tabla Anual (both tournaments' zone points, playoffs excluded) sets the continental berths behind the two champions and the Copa Argentina winner, six Libertadores and six Sudamericana places. Two clubs go down: the worst three-season promedio (prior points plus this year's over prior matches plus this year's) and the last club in the Tabla Anual, with the next-worst promedio stepping in if they coincide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>${G('forced', 'Forced results')}.</strong> Ties already decided on the pitch are forced by club pair: one decisive game, or two wins in a best-of-three, settles a pair; a two-legged tie is forced after its first decisive leg, so a first leg alone forces the Liguilla tie to that leg's winner, and a level aggregate falls back to the recorded aggregate or penalty winner.</p>
<h5>Cup kinds</h5>
${simpleTable(['Kind', 'Competitions', 'How the bracket is resolved'], [
  ['<code>swiss</code>', 'Champions League, Europa League, Conference League', CUP_KIND_TEXT.swiss + '. Undrawn pairings are drawn at random within the seeding rules; later rounds are two-legged with the better league-phase seed hosting the second leg.'],

])}
<p>The league or group phase of a cup is simulated as a league on (points, goal difference, goals, lots); decided ties are forced on aggregate; draws already made fix the pairings and undrawn rounds are drawn at random per simulation. Cups publish the winner probability, the chance of reaching each round, the league-phase or group position distribution, bands and expected points. The top-scorer race is not simulated for cups. One known gap: the Club World Cup's group and early knockout matches are sampled with home advantage for the listed home side although the tournament is neutral; only its final is neutral, and the fixture lines are unaffected.</p>
<h5>The top-scorer race</h5>
<p>For leagues and Argentina the same simulation carries a Golden Boot model. Candidates are the top twelve non-goalkeepers per club by goals, xG and minutes. Within a team, each simulation's remaining goals are split by one multinomial draw over the candidates plus an "other" bucket, with weights <code>2.0 × goals so far + 1.2 × goals per 90 + role base</code> (forward 0.40, midfielder 0.15; 1.5 for the whole "other" bucket). A player's total is current goals plus simulated goals; the leader wins, ties broken by assists then at random. Shares are fixed for the rest of the season and weighted heavily by goals already scored; injuries, transfers and rotation are not modelled.</p>
<h5>The position distribution and history</h5>
<p>The Table tab's heatmap is the finishing-position distribution per club, with the band cut lines drawn through it; split seasons show the post-split final position. Every hourly run appends a snapshot of the headline probabilities (title, the first band, relegation; MLS Cup and the Shield; a cup's winner and first band) to a store that keeps 400; the History tab plots the last 60, so the chart needs two runs before it appears.</p>` });

<h5>Aggregation and per-90 rates</h5>
<p>Every per-match statistic in a player's line-ups is summed over the season by player id; the club shown is the team of his latest appearance. The ${G('rating')} is the minutes-weighted mean of Sofascore's match ratings. Non-penalty goals are goals minus penalties counted from the incidents, and non-penalty xG is <code>max(xG − 0.79 × penalties taken, 0)</code>, 0.79 being the value the site assigns a penalty. A goalkeeper's goals conceded are the opponent's goals scaled by <code>min(minutes, 90) / 90</code>, and save percentage is saves over saves plus conceded. Ratio statistics (shots on target, pass completion, dribble success, duel success and so on) are built from summed numerators and denominators, never from averaged percentages. Every counting statistic gets a per-90 twin: <code>total / (max(minutes, 1) / 90)</code>.</p>
<h5>The catalogue</h5>
<p>The metric catalogue lists every metric the site computes (98 at the time of writing, in the groups Scoring, Creating, Passing, Carrying, Defending, Duels, Goalkeeping, Physical, Advanced, Rating, Discipline and Playing time), each with its label, format, scope (outfield, goalkeepers or all), whether it gets a ${G('percentile')} and whether lower is better. The leaderboards, the sliders on player pages, the compare page and the Player lab are built from that list, and the ${G('percentile', 'glossary')} defines every entry.</p>
<h5>Minutes floor and percentiles</h5>
${formula('floor = max(90, min(270, round(0.35 × most minutes played by anyone in the competition)))\n\npct   = round(100 × (peers below + 0.5 × ties) / n)      flipped for lower-is-better metrics')}
<p>${G('pool', 'Pools')} are positional: goalkeepers (by Sofascore's keeper flag), defenders, midfielders and forwards, with a residual outfield pool for anyone unlabelled; only players at or above the ${G('minutes_floor', 'floor')} are pooled, and a player below it has no percentiles ("not enough minutes"). A percentile is skipped when the pool has fewer than three values or the metric's scope does not fit the pool (goalkeeper metrics only for keepers, outfield metrics never for them). A leaderboard showing a season total uses the percentile of its per-90 twin.</p>
<h5>The advanced metrics</h5>

])}
<h5>League adjustment and the global pool</h5>
<p>The global leaderboards and the Player lab put players from different competitions together. Attacking rates are multiplied by the league's ${G('scoring_factor', 'scoring factor')} from the pooled fit (section 3), percentiles are recomputed over the global positional pools with a floor of 270 minutes, and the raw value, the factor and the adjusted value are all shown. Cups, national teams and Argentina carry a factor of 1.</p>
<h5>The Player lab: shrinkage and calendar windows</h5>
<p>The lab scatters any two catalogue metrics for one position group. "Shrink small samples" (on by default) pulls each rate towards the group median with 450 minutes of prior:</p>
${formula('shrunk rate = (minutes × rate + 450 × group median) / (minutes + 450)')}
<p>Five full matches move a player halfway from the median to his own figure; two thousand minutes leave him almost untouched. Hover shows the unshrunk figures and the axes say "(shrunk)". Axes where less is better are reversed so better is always up and to the right; the twelve players furthest into that corner by summed standard scores are labelled. The two calendar views ("last 12 months", "calendar year so far") read one line per player across every competition he played in over that window, club and national team, with his club being his latest club and league adjustment using the minutes-weighted blend of his competitions' factors; a banner names any competition whose detail does not yet reach back to the window's start (section 1). The minutes floor is 450 across competitions and 270 within one.</p>
<p>Sofascore labels positions only G, D, M and F, so wingers usually sit with the midfielders and wing-backs with the defenders, and a player's percentiles are against that label's pool.</p>` });

  S.push({ id: 'teams', title: 'Team analytics', html: `
<h5>Per-match rows and season profiles</h5>
<p>Each match with a team-statistics sheet gives one row per side: possession, xG and xGOT, shots (on target, off target, blocked, inside and outside the box), big chances, corners, offsides, fouls, cards, passes and accurate passes, touches in the box, final-third entries, long balls, crosses, through balls, tackles, interceptions, recoveries, clearances, errors, duels (ground and aerial, won and contested), dribbles, dispossessions, saves, goals prevented, distance and sprints, plus the opponent's shooting against (xG against, shots against, shots on target against, xGOT against). Where a sheet lacks xG the row falls back to the line-up sum. The season profile is the mean over the matches in which each value exists, with derived rates from sums:</p>
${formula('xg_diff     = xG − xG against                  xg_per_shot = Σ xG / Σ shots\nconv        = Σ goals / Σ shots                pass_pct    = Σ accurate passes / Σ passes\naerial_pct  = Σ aerials won / Σ aerials       ground_pct  = Σ ground duels won / Σ ground duels\nsave_pct    = (Σ shots on target against − Σ goals against) / Σ shots on target against')}
<p>Within-competition percentiles over the team catalogue use the same formula as players (share of clubs below, ties counting half, flipped for lower-is-better metrics such as xG against); the club page shows them as sliders and the compare page as pills with the club's rank. Two style measures are built on the match sheets: ${G('field_tilt')} is a team's share of the touches in both penalty areas (its box touches over its own plus the opponent's), territory rather than possession; ${G('ppda', 'PPDA')} is the opponent's passes divided by the team's defensive actions over the whole pitch, so a lower figure means a higher press. A match's ${G('xpts', 'expected points')} come from the two xG totals as independent Poisson means truncated at 8 goals (3 × P(win) + P(draw)); summed and subtracted from actual points they give ${G('luck', 'luck')} (section 6).</p>
<h5>Team of the week and the season XI</h5>
<p>The Analytics tab picks a team of the week for each round and a best XI for the season from the players' match ratings. A player needs 45 minutes in a match to be considered for a team of the week and a minimum of 60 minutes per match on average for the season XI, so a cameo cannot make either. Within those, a formation optimiser tries each listed shape (the shapes the tab shows, from a back four with three midfielders through a back three) and, for each, fills every line with the best-rated eligible players at that position, keeping the shape whose eleven rate highest in total. Positions are Sofascore's G, D, M and F, so the optimiser cannot distinguish a winger from a central midfielder.</p>` });

  S.push({ id: 'match-centre', title: 'The match centre', html: `
<p>A match page is descriptive; only two parts involve any computation.</p>
<h5>The expected result</h5>
<p>Every shot in the match is replayed <strong>20,000 times</strong> as a coin flip at its xG, seeded by the match id so that the card is stable between visits. The share of replays each side wins, draws or loses is the ${G('expected_result', 'expected result')}, alongside the chance of the actual scoreline and a scoreline heatmap with the real score outlined. One caveat the card states: rebounds count as separate chances, so a saved shot followed by a tap-in is two chances in the replay although only one could have been a goal.</p>
<h5>The pitch and the goal mouth</h5>
<p>Sofascore records a shot's position as its distance from the goal line being attacked (0 at the line) and its position across the pitch, both in percent of the pitch. The full-pitch shot map draws the home side attacking right, marker size by xG, colour by outcome, ring by team and symbol by body part; filters cover team, situation (open play, set pieces, penalties) and outcome, with a running summary of the filtered shots. "Where the shots went" draws each team's goal frame from the shooter's view with markers sized by xGOT; on Sofascore's goal-mouth scale the posts sit at y 44.6 and 55.4 and the bar at z 38, with higher y being the shooter's left. The xG race is the cumulative xG step line per side with a dot per shot sized by xG and goals in green; the momentum chart is Sofascore's pressure index (positive is home pressure).</p>
<h5>Everything else</h5>
<p>The summary tiles (xG and non-penalty xG, xG on target, shots and on target, xG per shot, big chances, possession), the chance-creators chart (xG and xA stacked per player), the team statistics by phase (with a derived block first: xG per shot, non-penalty xG, pass accuracy, field tilt, PPDA, xGOT − xG), the line-ups drawn on the pitch from the formation string and coloured by rating, and the sortable player table are read straight from the match's shard. Starters are kept in Sofascore's order within each line (from the team's right to its left) so that the drawing is faithful; when a formation string does not add up to ten outfielders the drawing is skipped and the starters are listed instead.</p>` });

  S.push({ id: 'markets', title: 'Markets', html: `
<p>The Market tab puts the model against real prices. No bets are placed or offered on this site; the comparison is a diagnostic of the model, and a "fair" price here is the model's, not anyone's offer.</p>
<h5>Prediction markets: Polymarket and Kalshi</h5>
<p>Since 30 September 2026 the match and title markets read the public data of Polymarket and Kalshi, with no key. A price is the <strong>midpoint of the best bid and ask</strong>; a market with no live two-sided quote, or a spread wider than 0.12, is skipped. A fixture has three yes/no markets (home, draw, away); each source is treated as a "book" of decimal odds 1 / p, ${G('devig', 'de-vigged')} multiplicatively (<code>p_i = (1 / o_i) / Σ_j (1 / o_j)</code>) and the sources are pooled by taking the median per outcome and renormalising (the ${G('consensus')}). A market event is matched to a fixture within 36 hours of kickoff when both clubs match after folding accents and suffixes (FC, AFC, CF…), by token subset or a similarity of at least 0.72, with ambiguous ties refused and a small alias table for city names (Kalshi's "Eindhoven" is PSV). The ${G('edge')} is relative, <code>model / market − 1</code>, and a fixture is flagged when it exceeds 3%. Two percentage points do not mean the same thing at 5% as at 50%, which is why the edge is relative.</p>
<p><strong>Titles.</strong> Kalshi's champion series and Polymarket's champion event are averaged per club and compared with the simulation's title probability (the cup or playoff winner probability where that is the prize). The title market is published only when at least half the field is quoted and the implied probabilities sum to between 0.8 and 1.3; a market that does not price every team would otherwise inflate the de-vigged probabilities and flatter the edge, which the page warns about when it happens. Markets usually list a matchday about a week ahead; the Fixtures tab carries the model's fair odds for every match regardless.</p>
${note('Read September edges as a diagnostic of the model, not as opportunities. The first run rated Manchester City 38% for the 2026–27 Premier League against the market\'s 18%, and Liverpool 0.4% against 7%, which says more about a model fitted mostly on five matches of a new season than about the market.', true)}
<h5>The Odds API (optional)</h5>
<p>Bookmaker head-to-head odds can be fetched from The Odds API (regions eu and uk, decimal odds, a fixed set of bookmakers) when an <code>ODDS_API_KEY</code> is present in the build environment and the competition has a sport key; without either the fetch is skipped and the tab says so. Bookmakers are de-vigged and pooled exactly as above. The bookmaker path currently returns no fixtures because the fetcher's row shape (one row per bookmaker outcome) does not match what the market builder expects (rows grouped by fixture with a book map), so every bookmaker market payload reads as unavailable; the de-vig and edge arithmetic are unit-tested on the grouped shape.</p>` });

<ul>
<li><strong>Early-season noise.</strong> A league five matches old is priced mostly on last season's goals and the pool's prior; xG rows exist only for the current season. Probabilities move a lot in the first two months, and a title market's disagreement with the model in September is more likely the model's error than the market's.</li>
<li><strong>Unofficial data.</strong> Everything rests on an unofficial API that blocks bursts and datacenter addresses. A challenge or an outage leaves the site on its last good data, flagged as stale; a spelling the registries do not know can drop a club from a join until an alias is added; voided and awarded matches arrive as negative scores and are dropped.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-block identification is weak.</strong> About six cup matches connect the continents in the pooled fit, so league ranks, scoring factors and league-adjusted player rates across blocks are mostly prior (section 3).</li>
<li><strong>The international fit is shallow between confederations</strong> (few cross-confederation matches), and national-team competitions are not simulated (section 4).</li>
<li><strong>Position labels are only G, D, M and F.</strong> Wingers sit with midfielders and wing-backs with defenders in every positional pool, radar and XI.</li>
<li><strong>No event data.</strong> Sofascore gives match totals, shots and incidents, not the full event stream. Progressive passes, passes into the box, pressures and packing do not exist here; "progressive carries" and "field tilt" are the closest available proxies.</li>
<li><strong>The rating is Sofascore's.</strong> It is their algorithm's match rating, minutes-weighted; the site does not compute its own.</li>
<li><strong>xG replaces goals rather than blending with them</strong>, club xG is not calibrated to goals, and rho is estimated from goals rows only (section 2).</li>
<li><strong>The fit drifts with the calendar</strong>: because the ridge is not rescaled with the time weights, parameters shrink very slowly towards zero between refreshes, a deterministic effect of about 3 × 10⁻⁵ per day on a home-win probability.</li>
<li><strong>Head-to-head tiebreaks are approximated</strong> by goal difference and goals scored in LaLiga and Serie A, and cups use (points, goal difference, goals) in place of their real tiebreak orders. The Belgian split is always simulated from scratch, and points quantiles use 2,000 simulations rather than the full run.</li>
<li><strong>Liguilla forced results are not aggregate-aware</strong>: a two-legged tie is forced after its first decisive leg and a level aggregate goes by strength share rather than seed.</li>
<li><strong>The ensemble's win/draw/loss triple and its score matrix disagree by a few points</strong> on blended fixtures; the simulators use the matrix, the fixture line the triple.</li>
<li><strong>Cup Elo is flat</strong> (unseeded, never updated), so an unknown club in a cup falls back to a pure home-advantage prior.</li>
<li><strong>Markets.</strong> Bookmaker odds are empty because of the row-shape defect; prediction-market prices exist only where those markets list a fixture, usually a week ahead.</li>
